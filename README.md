AI-powered social apps have reached 100 million monthly active users and continue to grow. In addition, real-person social apps have billions of users, requiring AI-assisted social interaction, indicating a vast market potential for llm-based social intelligence.

The Qwen-Character model is a branch model built upon the basic Qwen model. While the basic model models "world knowledge," the Qwen-Character model models "humans." Qwen-Character encompasses typical application scenarios such as role-playing, emotional companionship, avatar replication, smart hardware, and digital employees. Qwen-Character optimizes its modeling around six core human capabilities: personality, emotion, memory, mindset, knowledge, and morality, achieving leading results.
